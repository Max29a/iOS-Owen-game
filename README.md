# iOS-Owen-game

An app I wrote for my son when he was very young. The parent(s) can take a pic of their face and then its used throughout the game. I used Apples face detection to find the eyes and mouth in the added image. They are also prompted to record some voice clips.
The games are:
1. Food game - Spawn food and feed your parents. They say "yum" every couple of bites and also complain if one parent is getting fed more than the other.
2. Brush teeth game - Get the toothbrush lined up with the teeth for a brushing sound.
3. Train game - cause a train to cross the tracks, lowering/raising the arm and playing the warning sound
4. Shapes game - not implemented
